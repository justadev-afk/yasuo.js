# Rate limiting

Riot enforces **two** independent rate limits on every key, and both must be respected:

- an **application** limit, shared across *every* method on a routing host, advertised in `x-app-rate-limit`;
- a **method** limit, specific to a single endpoint, advertised in `x-method-rate-limit`.

Each header carries one or more `limit:intervalSeconds` windows (e.g. `100:120,20:1` — "100 per 120s **and** 20 per 1s"), and the matching `-count` headers (`x-app-rate-limit-count` / `x-method-rate-limit-count`) report how many requests you have already spent in each window. Blow through either limit and Riot answers `429 Too Many Requests` with a `retry-after` (seconds) and an `x-rate-limit-type` naming which limit you tripped.

yasuo handles both limits for you, on two fronts: **proactively**, by pacing requests *underneath* the advertised limits so `429`s are avoided before they happen, and **reactively**, by honouring `retry-after` with bounded backoff when one slips through anyway.

## Proactive: pace under the limit

The limiter keeps a **sliding window** per limit window, grouped into buckets:

- one **application bucket** per routing host (the app scope), and
- one **method bucket** per endpoint (`host:endpointId`).

Before a request is sent it must `acquire` a slot from *both* its app bucket and its method bucket. Each bucket permits a request only when **all** of its windows have a free slot and no penalty is active; otherwise the limiter sleeps until the oldest timestamp ages out. Because it reasons over a *rolling* window rather than fixed buckets, it never allows a boundary burst that would trip a `429` — provided yasuo is the only consumer of the key. Acquisition is serialised through an internal gate, so two concurrent requests can never both observe the same free slot and overshoot.

The real limits are **learned from response headers**: every response — success or failure — is fed back through `update`, which reconfigures the buckets in place from `x-app-rate-limit` / `x-method-rate-limit`. Existing windows keep their timestamp log, new intervals are added, and intervals Riot no longer advertises are dropped.

### Bootstrap: protecting the cold start

Before any headers have been seen, a fresh application bucket is seeded with conservative windows so an eager initial burst cannot trip a `429`:

```ts
// DEFAULT_BOOTSTRAP_APP_WINDOWS
[
  { limit: 20,  intervalSeconds: 1 },   // 20 req/s
  { limit: 100, intervalSeconds: 120 }, // 100 req / 2 min
]
```

These are Riot's **development-key defaults**. The moment a real response arrives, its headers replace them. (If you hold a production key with higher limits, the bootstrap only paces the very first handful of requests, then gets out of the way. Method buckets have no bootstrap — they stay unconstrained until Riot advertises a method limit.)

### `syncWithHeaders`: trusting Riot's count over your own

By default the limiter reconciles its local counters with Riot's `-count` headers (`syncWithHeaders: true`). When a response reports, say, `x-app-rate-limit-count: 7:1`, the window is **topped up** to at least 7 in-flight timestamps even if yasuo only recorded fewer locally. This protects you when the key is **shared** with another process (or another machine): you never believe you have more budget than Riot says you do. Set `syncWithHeaders: false` to ignore the counts and track only requests this client made.

## Reactive: honour `retry-after`

Proactive pacing cannot cover every case — a key shared across processes, a service blip, or a `503`. So when a `429` or `503` does come back:

1. The offending bucket is **penalised**: parked (`blockUntil`) until `retry-after` elapses. `x-rate-limit-type` decides which — `method` parks the method bucket, `application` the app bucket, and `service`/unknown parks **both** to be safe.
2. If retries are enabled and the status is retryable, the request is **retried**. The wait is Riot's `retry-after` when present (capped at `maxRetryAfterSeconds`), otherwise exponential backoff: `backoffBaseMs * 2 ** (attempt - 1)`.

Retries are bounded by `maxAttempts`. Retryable statuses are `429` always, plus `502`/`503`/`504` when `retryOnServiceUnavailable` is on. Once attempts are exhausted the most specific `ApiError` is thrown (a `429` surfaces as `RateLimitError`, whose `.rateLimits.retryAfterSeconds` you can read — see [errors.md](errors.md)).

## Configuration

Both fronts are configured on the `Yasuo` constructor. Each accepts a boolean shorthand or an options object.

```ts
const yasuo = new Yasuo({
  key,
  rateLimit: true, // proactive limiter — true (default) | false | RateLimiterOptions
  retry: true,     // reactive retries  — true (default) | false | RetryOptions
})
```

### `rateLimit: RateLimiterOptions`

| Option | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Proactive throttling on/off (reactive retries are unaffected). |
| `bootstrapAppWindows` | `RateLimitWindow[]` | `20/1s` + `100/120s` | Windows an app bucket uses before real limits are learned. |
| `syncWithHeaders` | `boolean` | `true` | Reconcile local counters with Riot's `*-count` headers. |
| `clock` | `Clock` | system clock | Injectable time source, primarily for deterministic tests. |

`rateLimit: false` is shorthand for `{ enabled: false }`; `rateLimit: true` (or omitted) is `{ enabled: true }`.

### `retry: RetryOptions`

| Option | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Retry throttled requests at all. |
| `maxAttempts` | `number` | `3` | Maximum retries after the initial request. |
| `maxRetryAfterSeconds` | `number` | `120` | Upper bound on how long a single `retry-after` is honoured. |
| `retryOnServiceUnavailable` | `boolean` | `true` | Also retry `502`/`503`/`504` service errors. |
| `backoffBaseMs` | `number` | `1000` | Base backoff (ms) used when no `retry-after` header is present. |

`retry: false` disables retries; `retry: true` (or omitted) uses the defaults above.

### Examples

```ts
import { Yasuo } from 'yasuo'

// 1. Defaults — proactive pacing + bounded reactive retries. Nothing to configure.
const a = new Yasuo({ key })

// 2. Disable proactive pacing (e.g. you pace elsewhere) but keep reactive safety.
const b = new Yasuo({ key, rateLimit: false })

// 3. Custom retry policy: fewer attempts, faster backoff, ignore service errors.
const c = new Yasuo({
  key,
  retry: {
    maxAttempts: 5,
    backoffBaseMs: 250,
    maxRetryAfterSeconds: 30,
    retryOnServiceUnavailable: false,
  },
})

// 4. Higher bootstrap ceiling for a production key, and trust only local counts.
const d = new Yasuo({
  key,
  rateLimit: {
    bootstrapAppWindows: [{ limit: 500, intervalSeconds: 10 }, { limit: 30000, intervalSeconds: 600 }],
    syncWithHeaders: false,
  },
})

// 5. Route through a rate-limiting proxy. The proxy owns the budget, so turn the
//    local limiter off and let it do the pacing. `{routing}`/`{game}` are filled in.
const e = new Yasuo({
  key,
  baseUrl: 'https://riot-proxy.internal/{routing}/{game}',
  rateLimit: false,
})
```

## Inspecting your budget at runtime

Rate-limit info travels *with* the data — no envelope to unpack. Every entity and every collection exposes `.rateLimits` (the parsed `RateLimits` from the response that produced it):

```ts
const summoner = await yasuo.lol.summoner.byPuuid(puuid, Region.KR)

summoner.rateLimits.app     // readonly RateLimitWindow[] — app-scoped windows
summoner.rateLimits.method  // readonly RateLimitWindow[] — method-scoped windows

for (const w of summoner.rateLimits.app) {
  console.log(`${w.count ?? 0}/${w.limit} used in the last ${w.intervalSeconds}s`)
}
```

Each `RateLimitWindow` is `{ limit, intervalSeconds, count? }` — `count` is Riot's reported usage for that window (`undefined` before the first response). Collections carry the same field:

```ts
const ids = await yasuo.lol.summoner.byPuuid(puuid, Region.KR).matchIds({ count: 20 })
console.log(ids.rateLimits.app)
```

After a throttled response, `retryAfterSeconds` tells you how long Riot wants you to wait:

```ts
console.log(summoner.rateLimits.retryAfterSeconds) // number | null (null when not throttled)
```

`RateLimits` also carries `type` (the `x-rate-limit-type` that caused a `429`, else `null`) and `edgeTraceId` (Riot's `x-riot-edge-trace-id`, handy for support). The full raw headers remain on `.meta.headers`.

## Concurrency

Independent of the limiter, the `concurrency` option caps how many requests may be **in flight** at once, via an internal semaphore:

```ts
const yasuo = new Yasuo({ key, concurrency: 10 }) // at most 10 requests on the wire at a time
```

It defaults to unbounded (`Infinity`). The two controls compose: the rate limiter decides *when* a request may leave (pacing under Riot's limits), and the semaphore caps *how many* are outstanding at once. Even with concurrency unbounded, the limiter still paces every request — `concurrency` is about connection pressure and memory, not about staying under Riot's limits.
