# Caching

Opt-in response caching, served **before the rate limiter is even consulted**. A cache hit returns instantly and never touches Riot — or your rate-limit budget. Caching is **off by default**; you turn it on per client.

## Why cache

Most Riot data changes slowly relative to how often you read it. A summoner's profile, a player's champion mastery, the static reference lists in Data Dragon — none of these move minute to minute. Re-fetching them on every request buys you nothing but latency and burned quota.

Caching earns you two things:

- **Latency.** A hit is an in-process (or Redis) lookup, not a network round-trip to Riot.
- **Rate-limit budget.** yasuo checks the cache *before* the proactive rate limiter. A hit never acquires a limiter slot, so cached reads don't count against your app or method limits at all.

The trade-off is staleness: a cached entry can be up to its TTL old. Tune the TTL to the volatility of the data (see [TTL guidance](#ttl-guidance)).

## Enabling the cache

The simplest form uses an in-memory store with a 60-second TTL:

```ts
import { Yasuo } from 'yasuo'

const yasuo = new Yasuo({ key, cache: true })   // in-memory MemoryCache, 60s TTL
```

For control over the store and TTL, pass a `CacheOptions` object:

```ts
const yasuo = new Yasuo({
  key,
  cache: { ttlMs: 30_000 },   // still in-memory, but expire after 30s
})
```

### `CacheOptions`

| Field     | Type         | Default                | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `enabled` | `boolean`    | `true` when an object is given | Master switch. Set `false` to disable without removing the config. |
| `store`   | `CacheStore` | a new `MemoryCache`    | Backing store. Swap in `RedisCache` or your own implementation.    |
| `ttlMs`   | `number`     | `60000` (60s)          | Time-to-live per entry, in milliseconds.                           |

Shorthand mapping:

- `cache: true` → in-memory store, 60s TTL.
- `cache: false` / omitted → caching off.
- `cache: { … }` → enabled with your overrides (unless `enabled: false`).

## How it works

The cache sits at the front of the request pipeline:

1. yasuo resolves the endpoint into a full request URL.
2. **Cache check** — if a fresh entry exists for that URL, it's returned immediately, before the rate limiter runs.
3. On a miss, the request proceeds through the limiter and out to Riot.
4. **On a successful (2xx) response only**, the result is stored under the URL for `ttlMs`.

A few consequences worth knowing:

- **Keyed by the resolved URL.** Two calls that produce the same URL (same routing, path params and query) share a cache entry. Different query params are different keys.
- **Only 2xx responses are cached.** Errors — `404`, `429`, `503` — are never stored, so a transient failure won't be served back to you until it expires.
- **Each entry stores `{ data, meta }`.** A hit reconstructs the exact same entity *and* its metadata, so `summoner.meta.status`, `summoner.rateLimits` and friends are all present on a cached read, just as on a live one. (The `rateLimits` on a hit reflect the response that was cached, not a fresh measurement.)
- **TTL is per entry.** Each write stamps its own expiry; there's no global flush timer.

## `MemoryCache`

The default store when you enable caching without naming one. A zero-dependency, in-process `Map` with per-entry TTL and a bounded size.

```ts
import { Yasuo, MemoryCache } from 'yasuo'

const yasuo = new Yasuo({
  key,
  cache: { store: new MemoryCache({ maxEntries: 5000 }), ttlMs: 60_000 },
})
```

### `MemoryCacheOptions`

| Field        | Type     | Default | Description                                                       |
| ------------ | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxEntries` | `number` | `10000` | Upper bound on stored entries. The oldest is evicted past this.  |
| `clock`      | `Clock`  | system  | Injectable time source, primarily for tests.                     |

Eviction is **FIFO** by insertion order: when the map exceeds `maxEntries`, the oldest key is dropped. Re-setting a key refreshes its position, so recently-written entries survive longest. Expired entries are also dropped lazily on read.

`MemoryCache` is per-process and per-client — it isn't shared across workers or restarts. For that, use Redis.

## Redis

`RedisCache` wraps any Redis-compatible client and stores values as JSON with a native Redis TTL, so **multiple processes share one cache**.

```ts
import { Yasuo, RedisCache } from 'yasuo'

const yasuo = new Yasuo({
  key,
  cache: { store: new RedisCache(redis), ttlMs: 30_000 },
})
```

> **yasuo has zero runtime dependencies — you bring your own Redis client.** yasuo does not bundle or install one; `RedisCache` just needs a client that satisfies the `RedisClientLike` shape (`get`, `set(key, value, 'PX', ttlMs)`, `del`).

Both of these work out of the box:

```ts
// Bun's built-in Redis client (preferred on Bun — no install):
import { redis } from 'bun'
const store = new RedisCache(redis)

// or ioredis, on Node:
import Redis from 'ioredis'
const store = new RedisCache(new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL))
```

node-redis v4 users can pass a small adapter that maps `del`/`set` onto its API. You can also namespace entries with `keyPrefix` (default `yasuo:`):

```ts
new RedisCache(redis, { keyPrefix: 'myapp:riot:' })
```

Note that `RedisCache.clear()` intentionally throws — flushing a shared Redis instance is too dangerous to do implicitly. Delete specific keys or flush the database out-of-band instead.

## Custom stores

Any object implementing the `CacheStore` interface can back the client. Methods may be **sync or async** — return a value or a promise, whichever suits your backend.

```ts
export interface CachedResult {
  readonly data: unknown
  readonly meta: ResponseMeta
}

export interface CacheStore {
  get(key: string): Promise<CachedResult | undefined> | CachedResult | undefined
  set(key: string, value: CachedResult, ttlMs: number): Promise<void> | void
  delete(key: string): Promise<void> | void
  clear(): Promise<void> | void
}
```

A minimal `Map`-backed store (no TTL — for illustration) is just:

```ts
import { Yasuo, type CacheStore, type CachedResult } from 'yasuo'

class SimpleCache implements CacheStore {
  private readonly map = new Map<string, CachedResult>()

  get(key: string) { return this.map.get(key) }
  set(key: string, value: CachedResult) { this.map.set(key, value) }
  delete(key: string) { this.map.delete(key) }
  clear() { this.map.clear() }
}

const yasuo = new Yasuo({ key, cache: { store: new SimpleCache() } })
```

Honour `ttlMs` in `set` if your backend supports expiry (`MemoryCache` and `RedisCache` do), and treat a miss or an expired entry as `undefined` from `get`. This is the same seam a CDN edge cache or Memcached adapter would plug into.

## TTL guidance

There's no universally right TTL — it depends on how fresh the data must be. A rule of thumb:

| Data                                          | Volatility | Suggested TTL      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Live/spectator game, current ranked LP        | high       | seconds (`5_000`)  |
| Match details, timelines (immutable once done) | none       | long (`3_600_000`) |
| Summoner profile, champion mastery            | low        | minutes            |
| Champion rotation, Data Dragon / static lists | very low   | hours              |

Immutable resources — a finished match, a specific Data Dragon version — can be cached aggressively; they never change once published. Volatile resources — a live game, a climbing ladder — want short TTLs so you don't serve stale state. When in doubt, start at the 60s default and lengthen it for the endpoints you know are slow-moving.

If you need different TTLs for different endpoints, run more than one `Yasuo` client, each with its own cache config.
