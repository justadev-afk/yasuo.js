# yasuo

yasuo is a modern, **zero-runtime-dependency** TypeScript client for the Riot Games API (LoL, TFT, Riot Account). It is the evolution of the `twisted` library. The full, binding conventions live in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — read it before making structural changes. The essentials:

- **Zero runtime dependencies.** Never add to `dependencies`. Small helpers go in `src/core/util`.
- **No magic strings/numbers.** Every Riot constant is an `enum` in `src/enums`. Reference the enum.
- **One declaration per file.** At most one class, or a few closely-related functions, or a cohesive group of types, per file.
- **Class member layout.** Order every class body top-to-bottom as: **public fields**, then **private/protected fields**, then the **constructor**, then **public methods**, then **private/protected methods** — with members **sorted alphabetically by name within each group**. Accessors (`get`/`set`) count as fields; `static` members sort by the same rules within their group; computed keys (e.g. `[Symbol.species]`) sort last in their group. Leave constructor **parameter properties** in the constructor (don't hoist them). Never move a field ahead of another that its initializer depends on. This rule is **classes only** — interfaces/DTOs keep their wire order.
- **DTOs mirror the wire (`src/dto`, `*DTO`, `readonly`); entities are the ergonomics (`src/entities`, `*.entity.ts`).** Entities use the interface+class **declaration-merging** pattern to expose DTO fields directly — this is why `noUnsafeDeclarationMerging`/`noEmptyInterface` are off in `biome.json`.
- **The query-builder + `.execute()` result model.** Namespace methods return a `SingleQuery`/`CollectionQuery` (or a lazy `*Ref extends SingleQuery`); nothing hits the network until `.execute()`. `.execute()` resolves the **entity/collection directly** (not a wrapper) — it carries `.error` (`ApiError | null`) and `.http` (`{ status, headers, rateLimits, ok, url }`). Scalar endpoints resolve a `ValueResult<T>` (read `.value`). Failures **don't throw**: `.error` is set and DTO fields are absent. Opt into throwing with `.execute({ throw: true })`; get the raw Riot payload with `.execute({ raw: true })` — typed `unknown` by default, or `execute<T>({ raw: true })` to assert a shape. Only *misuse* (missing key → `ApiKeyMissingError`) throws unconditionally. The 404-as-empty case (`spectator.active`) resolves to `null`.
- **Lazy `*-ref.ts` references `extends SingleQuery`** (no thenable/`PromiseLike`) so `byPuuid(...).matchIds().execute()` runs only the final request.
- **HTTP transport is pluggable and middleware-driven.** A custom `HttpClient` can be injected via `config.httpClient`. Axios-style `HttpMiddleware` (`(request, next, context) => Promise<response>`) stacks: **global** (`yasuo.use(...)` / `config.middleware`) wraps **per-service** (`yasuo.lol.summoner.use(...)`), composed in `RequestExecutor` around the transport via `composeMiddleware`.
- **The live API is the source of truth over Riot's published docs.** When they drift, type the observed shape, keep the legacy shape optional, and add a normalised accessor (see `ChampionRotationEntity`).
- **Every export is JSDoc'd.** Every network call flows through `RequestExecutor.request()`; namespaces never call `fetch` directly (except `DataDragonNamespace`).
- **Test everything; keep line coverage ≥ 95%.** New logic needs a unit test. The `test`/`test:unit` scripts run with `--coverage`, and `bunfig.toml` gates line/statement coverage at **95%** (currently ~97.5%). Network is never required for unit tests — inject `MockHttpClient` or a fake `HttpClient`/`fetch`. Live `test/integration/*.live.test.ts` are separate and skipped without `RIOT_API_KEY`.
- **HTTP transport is pluggable and cache stores are BYO.** Caching is opt-in and off by default; `config.cache.store` accepts a `CacheStore`, or a raw client that yasuo auto-wraps — a Redis client (`RedisClientLike` → `RedisCache`) or a Cloudflare Workers KV namespace (`KVNamespaceLike` → `KVCache`). No cache backend is ever a runtime dependency.
- **Every namespace has a reference page.** `docs/api/<product>-<namespace>.md` documents **every** public method of that namespace with, per method: its params, its return type (the entity/`Collection`/`ValueResult`/`null` that `.execute()` resolves), the key response fields, and a runnable `.execute()` example. Adding or changing an endpoint means updating its namespace page in the **same** change, and registering new pages in `mkdocs.yml`'s `nav` and `docs/api/index.md`. Data Dragon is the one exception (it returns awaited DTOs, not queries).
- **Keep the docs alive.** Any change to the public API must update the guides under `docs/`, the relevant `docs/api/*` reference page, and the compile-checked `examples/basic-usage.ts` in the **same** change. The MkDocs site (published to <https://justadev-afk.github.io/yasuo.js/>) is the canonical reference; `bun run docs:build` must stay green (`--strict`). Code fences require `pymdown-extensions>=10.14` (pinned in `docs/requirements.txt`) — older releases silently drop syntax highlighting.
- **Bump the patch version with every change.** `package.json`'s `version` must always sit **ahead of the remote's**. Before wrapping up a change, compare the local version to the one on the remote default branch — `git show origin/main:package.json` (the `version` field) — and if they still **match**, bump the **patch** segment (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`). If the local version is **already ahead** (this change, or an earlier one not yet released, already bumped it), leave it untouched — **one bump per unreleased set of changes**, never stack a second. Patch is the default; a `minor`/`major` jump is a deliberate manual call, not the automatic behaviour.

**Before "done":** `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, and `bun run test:unit` (coverage-gated) must all be green; new logic needs a unit test; new public surface is exported from `src/index.ts`; docs/examples updated to match; and `package.json`'s `version` is bumped ahead of the remote (patch, unless it was already bumped).

## Bun

Default to using Bun instead of Node.js.

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
- Use `bun build <file.html|file.ts|file.css>` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`
- Use `bunx <package> <command>` instead of `npx <package> <command>`
- Bun automatically loads .env, so don't use dotenv.

## APIs

- `Bun.serve()` supports WebSockets, HTTPS, and routes. Don't use `express`.
- `bun:sqlite` for SQLite. Don't use `better-sqlite3`.
- `Bun.redis` for Redis. Don't use `ioredis`.
- `Bun.sql` for Postgres. Don't use `pg` or `postgres.js`.
- `WebSocket` is built-in. Don't use `ws`.
- Prefer `Bun.file` over `node:fs`'s readFile/writeFile
- Bun.$`ls` instead of execa.

## Testing

Use `bun test` to run tests.

```ts#index.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hello world", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

## Frontend

Use HTML imports with `Bun.serve()`. Don't use `vite`. HTML imports fully support React, CSS, Tailwind.

Server:

```ts#index.ts
import index from "./index.html"

Bun.serve({
  routes: {
    "/": index,
    "/api/users/:id": {
      GET: (req) => {
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ id: req.params.id }));
      },
    },
  },
  // optional websocket support
  websocket: {
    open: (ws) => {
      ws.send("Hello, world!");
    },
    message: (ws, message) => {
      ws.send(message);
    },
    close: (ws) => {
      // handle close
    }
  },
  development: {
    hmr: true,
    console: true,
  }
})
```

HTML files can import .tsx, .jsx or .js files directly and Bun's bundler will transpile & bundle automatically. `<link>` tags can point to stylesheets and Bun's CSS bundler will bundle.

```html#index.html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <script type="module" src="./frontend.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

With the following `frontend.tsx`:

```tsx#frontend.tsx
import React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

// import .css files directly and it works
import './index.css';

const root = createRoot(document.body);

export default function Frontend() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}

root.render(<Frontend />);
```

Then, run index.ts

```sh
bun --hot ./index.ts
```
